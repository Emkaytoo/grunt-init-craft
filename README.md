grunt-init-craft
================

This is a grunt init template for personal Craft projects. If you don't work with me or my team, you probably don't want this (but maybe looking through it will help you create your own).

Installation
------------
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding).

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your ~/.grunt-init/ directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

	git clone git@github.com:alexgleason/grunt-init-craft.git ~/.grunt-init/craft

Usage
-----
At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

	grunt-init craft

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
