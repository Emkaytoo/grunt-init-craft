## Install

valet install
```

## Upgrading To Valet 2.0

Valet 2.0 transitions Valet's underlying web server from Caddy to Nginx. Before upgrading to this version you should run the following commands to stop and uninstall the existing Caddy daemon:

```bash
valet stop
valet uninstall
```

Next, you should upgrade to the latest version of Valet. Depending on how you installed Valet, this is typically done through Git or Composer. If you installed Valet via Composer, you should use the following command to update to the latest major version:

composer global require laravel/valet
Once the fresh Valet source code has been downloaded, you should run the install command:

```bash
valet install
valet restart
```

After upgrading, it may be necessary to re-park or re-link your sites.

## Valet Linking

In the terminal navigate to the `dist` folder and enter `valet link example`

This will then link http://example.dev to this dist folder.

You can enable ssl with `valet secure example`. You can disable ssl with `valet unsecure example`.

## Unable to Reach Host

Try running

```bash
sudo brew services start --all
```
